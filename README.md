# xiph package

Beware, this is my first atom package.
So, you want the "EierlegendeWollMilchSau"? For our english speaking audience ...
This is the german pendant of "Jack of all trades ...", more or less! haha

Anyway, since Atom seems to take over the universe ... we definitely need a nice
little plugin in there that let's you stream your favorite icecast-station, right???

Listen to any station in xiphs' icecast radio streaming directory!
